# Organization Settings Example  

The `illumio-core_workload_settings` resource cannot be created. For this example to work, import the resource into terraform by running the `import.sh` script included in this folder

```sh
$ terraform init
$ ./import.sh
$ terraform plan -out example-plan
$ terraform apply example-plan
```
